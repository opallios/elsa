Installing and Configuring Fluentd
-----------------------------------
As of ODE 0.3, fluentd needs to be manually installed and configured on ODE box in order for it to be functional.
Please refer to documentation at,http://opalliosode.org/documentation/fluentd/, for the Fluentd (in ODE) user's guide. 

There are some sample configuration files that can be used as reference when adding your data sources for fluentd consumption.
